Jesus and all the New Testament writers talk about Genesis 1–11 as history that is true. Jesus talks about Moses’ writings and about the time when God made Adam and Eve (Matthew 19:4). Paul tells the men in Athens that God is the One who made the earth “and everything in it. He is the Lord of the land and the sky. He does not live in temples built by human hands” (Acts 17:24, ERV). The New Testament writers built their teachings on the Bible truth in Genesis. In this way, these writers show the modern readers that God’s work in Genesis 1 and 2 is important.
