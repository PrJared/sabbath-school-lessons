MANY FAMOUS THINKERS in the past read the Bible. They learned how God made the earth. This Bible truth made them excited to learn more about nature. So, they started to explore God’s work. Their research led to the start of modern science. Some of these scientists were Johannes Kepler, Isaac Newton, John Ray, and Robert Boyle. These scientists believed that their work showed humans even more about the work that God made.

After the French Revolution, science changed. Scientists stopped believing in God. Scientists did not include God in their work. Charles Darwin made this new idea popular in his book On the Origin of Species (1859). Since that time, science has moved far away from the Bible. Because of this, people no longer believe in the Genesis story. They say it is a made-up story that does not show us real history.

Does the Bible teach that idea? Was the Bible’s story about how life started on this earth a story that God’s people took from the people around them? Or does the story in Genesis really show us a view about how life started? Can we trust the Bible? Is its information true?

These are some of the questions we will answer in this week’s lesson.

_Johannes Kepler was a scientist. He believed his work showed humans more about the work that God made._
