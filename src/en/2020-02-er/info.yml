  title: "How to Understand the Bible"
  description: "As Seventh-day Adventists, we are Protestants. That means that we believe in “sola Scriptura.” “Sola Scriptura” means only the Bible is the support for our faith and all our teachings. This is an important belief in the last days. Ellen G. White shows us why: “God will have a people on the earth who will say that the Bible and the Bible only shows everyone what they should believe. The Bible also is the reason for any changes that we make in our lives for the better.”—The Great Controversy, page 595, adapted."
