> “The Word (Christ [Jesus]) was in the beginning. The Word was with God. The Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. He made all things. Nothing was made without Him making it. Life began by Him. His Life was the Light for men” (John 1:1–4, NLV).

THE FIRST CHAPTERS OF GENESIS are important. They show us the most important teachings in the Bible. We see the Father, the Son (John 1:1–3; Hebrews 1:1, 2), and the Holy Spirit (Genesis 1:2). They work together to make the earth and humans (Genesis 1:26–28). We learn about the Sabbath (Genesis 2:1–3) and how evil started (Genesis 3). We learn about the Savior and God’s plan to save us (Genesis 3:15). We learn about the worldwide Flood (Genesis 6–9) and God’s agreement (Genesis 1:28; Genesis 2:2, 3, 15–17; Genesis 9:9–17; Genesis 15). Genesis also shows us why people started talking in different languages (Genesis 10; Genesis 11). The family lists in Genesis show us Bible history from the time God made the earth to Abraham’s time (Genesis 5 and Genesis 11). Finally, in Genesis we see the power of God’s spoken Word (Genesis 1:3; 2 Timothy 3:16; John 17:17). We learn about marriage (Genesis 1:27, 28; Genesis 2:18, 21–25), taking care of God’s gifts (Genesis 1:26; Genesis 2:15, 19), and God’s promise of a new earth (Isaiah 65:17; Isaiah 66:22; Revelation 21:1). All these topics start in Genesis. Genesis will be our study this week and next week.

_In Genesis, we learn about the worldwide Flood (Genesis 6–9)._
