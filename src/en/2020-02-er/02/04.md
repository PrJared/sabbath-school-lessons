“Then the Lord said to Moses, ‘Write everything that I have told you. This is the agreement that I made with you and the Israelites’ ” (Exodus 34:27, ERV). Why does the Lord ask Moses to write His words and say them to the people? Why is it good to have a written copy of God’s Word, the Bible?

God made human language. He helps His servants to share His truths and thoughts in words that we can trust. So, we are not surprised to learn that God told the Bible writers to write down His teachings and truths.

**What do the verses below teach us about why God told His servants to write His messages down?**

`Exodus 17:14; Exodus 24:4`

`Joshua 24:26`

`Jeremiah 30:2`

`Revelation 1:11, 19; Revelation 21:5; and Revelation 22:18, 19`

Why did God tell His servants to write down His messages? So we will remember them better. We can trust information we read more than we can trust information that someone says to us. Writings can be copied many times. They can be shared with many people all over the earth.
