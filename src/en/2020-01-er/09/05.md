`Read Daniel 8:14. What happens in this verse?`

The little horn makes war against God’s people. Then an angel announces that the temple will be cleaned. How are we to understand this message? First, we must remember that the temple cleaning in Daniel 8:14 happens during God’s work as Judge in Daniel 7:9–14. Where does God’s work as Judge happen? In heaven. So, the temple must be in heaven too. Now we can understand better what Daniel 7 and Daniel 8 are all about. Daniel 7 shows God’s work to save humans. Daniel 8 shows us how this same work includes the temple.

God’s temple on earth was an exact copy of the temple in heaven. The temple on earth showed God’s plan to save humans and solve the sin problem. Every day, sinners brought their gifts to the temple. They said they were sorry for their sins. They were forgiven. Then those sins were carried into the temple. That made the temple dirty. So, the top holy leader had to make the temple clean again. He did that one day a year. That day is named the Day of Atonement, or Cleaning From Sin (Leviticus 16).

Why should the temple in heaven need to be cleaned? When we confess our sins, those sins go into heaven’s temple. In the same way, the holy leader took the sins of the forgiven Israelites into the temple on earth. On the Day of Atonement, or Cleaning From Sin, many animals were killed. These animals showed Jesus’ future death. His death gives sinners power to stand in front of God on the Day of Atonement.

In the same way, Jesus’ blood alone protects us during the time God judges us. Daniel 8:14 tells us God will clean sin from heaven’s temple just as the holy leaders cleaned it from the temple on earth. The message of Daniel 8:14 is clear. As sinners, we need Jesus’ blood. He forgives us our sins and helps us to stand in front of God our Judge.

`Read Hebrews 9:23–28. How do these verses show us that Jesus’ death on the cross saves us from sin?`

As sinners, we need Jesus’ blood. He forgives us our sins and helps us stand clean in front of God our Judge.
