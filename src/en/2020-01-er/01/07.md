**Additional thought**: 

“God made the Bible to be our guide. The Bible will show everyone God’s plan to save them. God gave men special messages about the future to help them know His plan. These messages are true and sure. Angels and even Jesus Himself came to Daniel and John with special messages. The angels and Jesus showed Daniel and John the things that must shortly happen. God’s special messages show us that God’s plan to save us is important. God does not keep secret the information about His plan. God does not share this information in a way that will confuse the honest person who wants to know Bible truth. That is why God told Habakkuk, His special messenger: ‘ “Write down what I show you. Write it clearly on stone tablets [a writing pad] so whoever reads it can run to tell others [people].” ’ Habakkuk 2:2 [ICB]. The Bible is clear for everyone who studies it with prayer. Every honest person who looks for truth will find it. ‘Light and happiness shine on those [people] who want to do right.’ Psalm 97:11, [ERV]. A church will become holy when its members search for truth. They must hunt for it the same as hidden treasure.”—Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, pages 521, 522, adapted. 

“Study the history of Daniel and his friends. They lived in a place where the devil tried to get them to sin all the time. But Daniel and his friends honored God. They gave Him glory in their daily lives. They decided to stay away from all evil. They refused to walk down the road to sin. They stayed loyal to God. God gave them rich blessings.”—Ellen G. White, Manuscript Releases, volume 4, pages 169, 170, adapted. 

**Discussion questions**

`1. The book of Daniel shows us that God is in control of everything that happens. He also knows how everything is going to end. What comfort and hope does this knowledge give us? The Lord knows all your thoughts too. That shows you how close He is to you. How does that thought comfort you?`

`2.	In class, talk about the different types of prophecy: end-time prophecy and regular prophecy. What other examples of these two types of prophecy can you find in the Bible?`
