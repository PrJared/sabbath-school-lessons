Who were the first missionaries that Jesus ever sent out? They were not among the disciples. They were not among His long-time followers. The first missionaries that Jesus sent out had been mad men, demoniacs who a few hours before had terrorized the countryside and struck fear into the hearts of the neighboring villagers.

With supernatural demonic power, one of these demoniacs broke the chains that bound him, shrieked in horrific tones, and mutilated his own body with sharp stones. The agony in their voices only reflected a deeper agony in their souls (Matt. 8:28, 29; Mark 5:1–5).

But then they met Jesus, and their lives were changed. They would never be the same. Jesus drove the tormenting demons out of their bodies into a herd of pigs and over a cliff into the sea (Matt. 8:32–34; Mark 5:13, 14).

`Read Mark 5:1–17. What happened to these men, and what did the townspeople find when they came out to see what had happened? `

The demoniacs were now new men transformed by the power of Christ. The town’s people found them sitting at the feet of Jesus, listening to every word from the Master’s mouth. We should note that Matthew’s gospel says that there were two demoniacs delivered, while Mark’s gospel focuses the story on only one of the two. But the point is, Jesus restored them physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.

`Read Mark 5:18–20. Obviously these changed demoniacs, these new converts, wanted to stay with Jesus, but what did Christ send them to do?`

“For a few moments only these men had been privileged to hear the teachings of Christ. Not one sermon from His lips had ever fallen upon their ears. They could not instruct the people as the disciples who had been daily with Christ were able to do. But they bore in their own persons the evidence that Jesus was the Messiah. They could tell what they knew; what they themselves had seen, and heard, and felt of the power of Christ. This is what everyone can do whose heart has been touched by the grace of God.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 340. Their testimonies prepared Decapolis, ten cities on the shores of the Sea of Galilee, to receive the teachings of Jesus. This is the power of personal testimony.
