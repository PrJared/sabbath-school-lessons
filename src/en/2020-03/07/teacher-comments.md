#### Part I: Overview

The inspired Word of God contains life-giving principles. When the Christ-centered teachings of Scripture are accepted by faith, our lives are transformed. The creative power of the Word of God illuminates our darkness. It changes us. Jesus is the great miracle worker. He is the life changer. Because He is at the center of all scriptural teaching, as the apostle Paul states so clearly, “If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new” (2 Cor. 5:17, NKJV). Jesus adds, “The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life” (John 6:63, NKJV). 

The Bible is not merely a to-do manual on how to construct a Christian life. It is the Living Word of God that transforms our lives. In this week’s study, we will explore the transforming power of God’s Word. We will study symbols of the Word, such as light, fire, hammer, seed, and bread. These varied images have one thing in common. They reveal the power of God’s Word to change our lives. When you share the Word of God with the people in your sphere of influence, it is like light that guides them through the dark valleys of their lives. It is like a fire that burns within their soul. It is like a hammer that breaks their hard hearts. It is like seed that silently grows and produces the fruits of the Spirit in their lives. It is like bread that nourishes their spiritual hunger. In this week’s lesson, we will discover the transforming power of God’s Word.

#### Part II: Commentary

The Psalmist David declares, “Your Word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path” (Ps. 119:105, NKJV). He also adds “the entrance of Your words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple” (Ps. 119:130, NKJV). Light always involves the removal of darkness. If you were on a dark path at night without a light, you might easily veer off the path. It would not be uncommon to stumble and fall into a deep ravine without a light. A powerful flashlight would make all the difference. The Word of God lights the pathway of the followers of Christ. It guides us home. Jesus is the “light of the world” (John 8:12, NKJV), who lights up our darkness through His Word. When we share the Word of God with others, it dispels the darkness in which Satan has enshrouded their lives and lightens their pathway to the kingdom of God.

In Jeremiah 23:29, God’s Word is compared to both fire and a hammer. It is compared to fire because it consumes. When we share the Word of God with others, the fire of God’s Word burns within their soul, consuming error. God’s Word is also like a hammer. The term “hammer” may seem like an unusual term to use to describe the Bible. Hammers nail things together. They also smash things. The hammer of God’s Word smashes hard hearts to pieces. Think of the dramatic changes that took place in the lives of the demoniacs, the Roman centurion, the thief on the cross, and a host of others throughout the New Testament. The Word of God pounded away at their hard hearts until they were broken by the hammer of love. 

In one of the more common symbols in Scripture, the Bible is compared to “seed.” In Luke 8:11, Jesus states, 

“ ‘The seed is the word of God.’ ” There is life in a tiny seed. When the seed of God’s Word is planted in the soil of the mind, it produces an abundant harvest in the life. Jesus often used the symbolism of seed to describe the growth of His kingdom. The Word of God scattered like seed throughout the world would produce a bountiful harvest. “And He said, ‘The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground, and should sleep by night and rise by day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he himself does not know how’ ” (Mark 4:26, 27, NKJV). Bible commentator, Matthew Henry, commenting on this passage makes this insightful statement, “It [the seed] will come up though it seem lost and buried under the clods, it will find or make its way through them. The seed cast into the ground will spring [forth]. Let but the word of Christ have the place it ought to have in a soul and it will show itself, as the wisdom from above doth in a good conversation.”—Matthew Henry’s Commentary on the Whole Bible, vol. 5, p. 383. Matthew Henry’s point is clear. The Word of God may seem buried someplace within the mind. It may seem to be covered under the clods of sin, but if it is cherished, it will spring forth into new life. It will radically change our attitudes, our conversation, our habits, and our lifestyle. Seed is life-giving.

The Bible also uses the term bread to describe the Word of God. Jesus said, “ ‘I am the bread of life’ ” (John 6:35). He adds, “ ‘Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God’ ” (Matt. 4:4, NKJV). 

Bread was the staff of life throughout the ancient world and one of our planet’s basic foods. It is an essential dietary item. An individual can survive a long time on only bread and water. By using the illustration of bread, Jesus is declaring that He is essential for life. 

Following the miracle of the feeding of five thousand in His well-known, bread-of-life sermon, Jesus declares, 

“ ‘Whoever who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life” (John 6:54, NKJV). This seems like a very strange statement. What could Jesus possibly be talking about? Obviously, He was not talking about literally eating His flesh and drinking His blood. By feasting on His Word, His teachings become part of our lives. This is what Jeremiah meant when he joyfully declared, “Your words were found, and I ate them, and Your word was to me the joy and rejoicing of my heart; For I am called by Your name, O LORD God of hosts” (Jer. 15:16, NKJV).

There is nothing as satisfying as the discovery of the truth about Jesus in every teaching of Scripture. Encourage your class to share the wonderful truths of Jesus and the encouraging promises of His Word with others around them.

When people are going through a transition in their lives, they are more likely to be open to the gospel. They may be facing health challenges, a job crisis, a relationship issue, or some other difficulty in their lives. Ask God to help you to be sensitive to people around you and give you the wisdom to discern their openness to the Word of God. 

Jan had just moved to a new city. Her husband died, and she was becoming disillusioned with her faith. A Bible study interest card arrived at her door. Although she may not have been interested in an in-depth study of God’s Word a year or so before the card arrived, she was going through a transition in her life at that moment and was looking for something more. She had a hidden hunger that could not be satisfied with a superficial faith. She responded to the mailing, sent in the Bible study interest card, studied the Bible lessons, and today is rejoicing in the truth of God’s Word.

**Additional Commentary**

The amazing thing about God’s Word is that it carries with it the power to accomplish what it declares. God’s Word is a living Word. Other books may be inspiring, but the Bible is inspired and contains the power of the Life-Giver. It does not merely contain truth; it is truth in its very essence. The living truths of the Bible not only declare what is so, they accomplish what they declare in the life of those who believe. (See Heb. 3:19, Heb. 4:12.) 

Throughout Scripture, passages like 2 Peter 1:4, James 1:21, and Acts 20:32 assure us that through the Word of God, we become “partakers of the divine nature,” save our souls through “the implanted word,” (NKJV) and will receive “an inheritance among all them which are sanctified.” When by faith we accept the Word of God as the living Word of Christ, everything Jesus has promised us becomes ours. His Word is “profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness” (2 Tim. 3:16).

Your primary goal as the teacher in this class is to share with class members an exalted view of the inspired Word of God and encourage them to share the promises and teachings of the Word with others. Our role is not to convert people. That’s the Holy Spirit’s role. Our role is to share the life-changing teachings of God’s Word and allow the Holy Spirit to deeply impress these teachings on the lives of others.

#### Part III: Applying the Word

The promises of God’s Word are like traveler’s checks. At times when people go on vacation to a foreign country and do not want to risk taking cash, they purchase traveler’s checks from the bank. These traveler’s checks are risk free. If you lose one or they are stolen, they are backed up by the bank. When you purchase the checks, you sign them and then when you cash them you sign them again. God’s promises are backed up by all of His riches in glory. Heaven’s exhaustless riches never run out. Best of all, their benefits already have been purchased for us on the cross. All we do is accept the provisions of His promises by faith, and even faith itself is a gift He gives us. This week invite your class to:

1.	Memorize the five following promises of God’s Word: 1 John 1:9, 1 Cor. 10:31, Phil. 4:13, Phil. 4:19, 1 John 5:17, 18.
2.	Write each promise on an index card and read them over each day.
3.	Ask God to bring someone into your life to share one of these promises with. Pray for spiritual discernment to recognize where God already is working on someone’s heart.
4.	Be ready to share in next week’s class how God has used you this week.
