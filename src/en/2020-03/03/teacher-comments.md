**Key Text**: Mark 8:22-26

**Study Focus**: John 4:3-34, Acts 26-28.

#### Part 1: Overview

The theme of this week’s lesson, “Seeing People Through Jesus’ Eyes,” focuses especially on the significance of one person leading another to Jesus. Jesus saw people not as they were but as they might become. He saw their potential for the kingdom of God. He perceived the divine longings within each individual to know God. 

When we see people through Jesus’ eyes, we see each person we meet as winnable for Christ because they were created in His image. Despite the circumstances of their lives, they have an inner desire to know Him. This was true of the Samaritan woman, the Ethiopian eunuch, the thief on the cross, the Roman centurion and many other New Testament seekers. There is an emptiness of soul without Christ.

Recognizing this eternal truth enables us to see people with new eyes, whether or not they realize they have a God-shaped vacuum in their lives. Although individuals have felt needs that are obvious, they also have an eternal longing to know God. There is a hidden hunger of the soul. Twenty-first century men and women are starved for a knowledge of God.

It is God’s plan that each one of us sees and seizes the opportunities around us to lead our friends to Jesus. Many people will never come unless we bring them. One of the great myths is that people have no interest in spiritual things. If we believe that people are not interested, we will not see the interest they may have. Jesus saw people as winnable, and they responded to His belief in them.

#### Part II: Commentary

**Jesus Heals the Blind Man at Bethsaida**

Christ’s two-stage healing of the blind man at Bethsaida has special significance for our witness today. It is important to note the location of this healing. Bethsaida is believed to be located on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee. Scholars debate its exact location. The city is frequently mentioned in the Gospels along with Jerusalem and Capernaum. It was here that Jesus called Philip, Peter, and Andrew to become His disciples. 

In addition to Jesus’ compassion for this blind man, it is evident that He was teaching a deeper spiritual lesson to His disciples. He desired them to recognize that there were needy people all around them who would be open to the gospel if their physical needs were met first. Such needy souls were present even in Bethsaida.

There are some important reasons why Jesus healed this blind man in two stages. Because this cure is the only time in the Gospels that one of Jesus’ healing miracles was not instantaneous, there must be some significance in this miracle not seen in other places in Scripture. First, the miracle reveals Jesus’ compassion. Have you ever walked out of a dark room into the bright light? For a moment you were blinded. It takes time for the eyes to adjust to light if you have been in the dark. If you were blind, a sudden bright light would affect you even more. Jesus healed the man in two stages so his eyes would gradually adapt to the light. Jesus is gracious. He understands our condition and lovingly ministers to our needs.

As we share the light of God’s truth with our friends, it is well to remember that “the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day” (Prov. 4:18). Just as the light of the sun gradually rises dispelling the darkness, so the light of God’s truth gradually illuminates our minds until we walk in its full light. Light can be blinding as well as illuminating. Jesus understood this principle and left His disciples a vivid example of how to present truth in the two-stage healing of this blind man.

It is also possible that Jesus desired to reveal to His followers that each one of us needs the second touch. Too often we are partially blind. We see those around us as “trees walking around.” When the Holy Spirit causes the scales to fall from our eyes, we too will see those around us much more clearly. 

Mark 8:25 says, “Then He put His hands on his eyes again and made him look up. And he was restored and saw everyone clearly” (NKJV). The Greek word for “clearly” is delaugos, which is better translated as “radiantly” or “in full light.” When Christ heals our spiritual blindness, we see others as Christ sees them in the full light of His love.

**Jesus Ministers to a Samaritan Woman**

The most direct route from Jerusalem to Galilee was through Samaria, but because of their animosity with the Samaritans, the Jews avoided this route. They regularly took the longer and more circuitous route through the Jordan Valley. John 4:4 states that Jesus, “must needs go through Samaria.” He did not need to go through Samaria geographically. There were other ways to get to Galilee. Jesus had a divine appointment at the well with a Samaritan woman that would make an eternal difference. 

Jesus desired to break down the walls of prejudice between the Jews and the Samaritans. His single-minded objective was to reveal to His disciples that the Samaritans were open to the gospel. Jesus saw this troubled woman through the eyes of divine compassion. He astutely observed that she came to the well at noon, the hottest part of the day. This was a strange time to come to draw water. The village women came in the early morning hours. There they gathered, socialized, and drew their water supply for the day. Evidently this woman wanted to avoid the gossip that would ensue due to her lifestyle if she came at the same time as the rest of the women.

She may have been embarrassed. Her profligate lifestyle left her an outcast. She was well-known, and she desired to avoid as much contact as possible. Her sole desire was to quickly gather her daily supply of water and return home. She was surprised to find this Galilean Jewish stranger at the well. She was even more surprised when He spoke to her. The Jews had no dealings with the Samaritans. When Jesus asked her for a favor, she could not refuse. In the barren, desert lands of the Near East and Middle East, it is still believed today that water is a gift of God. To refuse a cup of water to a weary traveler is an offense against the Almighty. 

Gently, almost imperceptibly, Jesus broke down the barriers between them, won her confidence, then appealed directly to her inner longings for freedom from guilt and eternal life. She first recognized He was a righteous man, then acknowledged that He was more than a religious teacher—He must be a prophet of God. As the Holy Spirit awakened divine impulses within her soul, she sensed that Jesus may be the Messiah (John 4:11, 15, 19, 26).

Excited, she forgets the very reason she comes to the well, leaves her water pot behind, and runs to tell the story of her encounter with Christ. Her testimony produces a spiritual revival in the entire area (John 4:39-41). When the disciples return from their journey to buy food, Jesus shares with them this divine insight: the Samaritans are open and receptive to the gospel. For the disciples, this reality is almost unbelievable. The lesson that Christ teaches them is for every generation. God is working in unexpected places. Keep your eyes open, and you will see the providential working of the Holy Spirit in the lives of those whom you may not expect to receive the gospel (John 4:35-38).

**Illustration**: Berry Picking and Soulwinning

One night, Ellen G. White had a dream about berry picking and soulwinning. Along with a large group of young people, she went berry picking. A horse-drawn wagon carried their supplies and brought them to the location that was filled with whortleberry bushes. There are various types of whortleberries also known as huckleberries. They are either blue or red and quite delicious. They are healthy too, packed as they are with antioxidants. Ellen White noticed the bushes filled with berries close to the wagon and began to pick them. Soon she had filled two buckets. The others in her group scattered and came back later with empty buckets. She admonished them that while they were looking for berries a distance away from the wagon, there were plenty right before them, if they would only open their eyes to see them.

#### Part III: Life Application

**Start Where You Are**

Jesus urged disciples to begin sharing the gospel where they were. There is no other place to begin then the place you are. The disciples were first to share the gospel in Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria, and then in the uttermost parts of the earth. There are people all around us looking for the peace and purpose that only Christ can give. Jesus invites us to begin sharing His love in our families, our neighborhoods, our workplaces, and communities. 

Andrew began with his own family and shared the gospel with his brother Peter. On another occasion, he developed a relationship with a little boy who, because of the confidence he had in Andrew, gave his entire lunch to Jesus. Little in the hands of Jesus is much, and small in the hands of Jesus is great. Jesus always begins with what He has. He fed five thousand on the hillsides of Galilee with only five loaves and two fishes. Andrew was not as outgoing as Peter. He did not have the same leadership qualities, but he was an introducer. Every time we read about Andrew, we find him introducing somebody to Jesus. 

The Gospels are filled with stories of Jesus sharing God’s love with one person at a time. A Jewish scribe, a Roman tax collector, a Canaanite woman, a Jewish religious leader, and a young thief all experienced His loving touch. They were transformed by His grace.

Think about who in your sphere of influence you may share God’s love with. Who among your family or friends might be most receptive? Start there. Ask God to impress you with who might be seeking Him now. You may be surprised with how God opens doors for you to share His love with people all around you whom you never thought would be open or receptive.
