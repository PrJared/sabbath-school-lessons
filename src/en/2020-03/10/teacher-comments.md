#### Part I: Overview

In some parts of the world, small groups form the basis of spiritual nurture and outreach for the church. In other parts of the world, there are few, if any, small groups in local congregations. Small groups are described throughout Scripture in a variety of ways. Although they are outlined in Exodus as part of Moses’ organizational plan for Israel, they are a major focus of New Testament witness both in the ministry of Jesus and the first-century church. 

Small groups serve multiple functions in the Bible, and not all are organized the same way. There are a variety of types of groups. Some are primarily nurture groups that emphasize prayer and Bible study. Other groups are more witness and outreach focused, and still others provide for Christian fellowship and problem solving. The most common feature in the Scriptures is that small groups blend prayer, Bible study, fellowship, and witness. Successful small groups that are sustainable must have all four of these elements. 

Small groups that fail to have a mission focus often do not survive very long. Small groups with only a mission focus and little or no prayer, Bible study, and fellowship often “burn out” their members in ceaseless activity. In this week’s lesson, we will take a brief look at Old Testament small groups, but we will spend most of our time in carefully surveying Jesus’ small group ministry and the dynamic multifaceted small groups in the book of Acts.

#### Part II: Commentary

The first verse in the Bible, “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth” (Gen. 1:1, NKJV) uses the plural word for God in the text. It is the Hebrew noun “Elohim.” Throughout Christian history, scholars have seen in this verse the concept of the Godhead, or the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. 

This concept is even clearer in Genesis 1:26. “Then God said, “ ‘Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness’ ” (Gen. 1:26, NKJV). Here the plural name for God (Elohim) is combined with the plural pronouns “ ‘Us’ ” and “ ‘Our’ ” to once again indicate the plurality of the Godhead. Genesis 1, combined with the further revelation of Scripture, provides rock-solid evidence that the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit, as three separate eternal beings, co-existed in a small group of indivisible oneness and worked together in varying roles to create this world and the cosmos. (See Gen. 1:1, 2; Eph. 3:9; Heb. 1:1-3; Col. 1:13-17.)

The Bible teaches that God did not exist alone. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit existed together from all eternity in intimate fellowship and abounding love for one another. The love reflected in the relationship of the members of the Godhead and their cooperation together in Creation and Redemption are an example for all small groups today. 

We see this truth modeled in the New Testament, especially in the ministry of Jesus and His disciples. Luke 6:13 records Jesus, selecting the twelve disciples from among His many followers. Before His selection, He “continued all night in prayer” (Luke 6:12, NKJV). As the Holy Spirit impressed Him, He chose twelve disciples to become part of His small group. Within that small group, His inner circle of Peter, James, and John had the closest contact with Him. Jesus prayed with and for His disciples. He shared the Word of God with them. They often ate together, developed lasting bonds of fellowship, shared one another’s lives and participated in Christ’s mission together. 

Although they were men of varied backgrounds, different personalities, wide-ranging temperaments, and diverse understandings, Jesus was able to bring them together after the resurrection with the single-minded focus of reaching the world for Christ. Together they were stronger than if they were apart. In unity there is strength, and in division there is weakness. When church members are organized into small groups, united in mission, in which each member understands his or her role in the body of Christ, the church will have a powerful witness to the world. 

Let’s consider some examples of small-group ministry in the book of Acts. Acts 2 records that there were 3,000 people baptized on the day of Pentecost. How were these early Christians nurtured following conversion? What kept the Christian church strong? The record states, “And they continued steadfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers” (Acts 2:42, NKJV). This passage is extremely instructive. The new converts were nurtured in small groups through prayer, social fellowship, and a renewal of their faith through Bible study. Their lives were filled with “gladness” and “praise.” The community around them was moved by the testimony of their words and the witness of their lives. This witness was so powerful that “the Lord added to the church daily” (Acts 2:47). A united church, organized for service, is a powerful witness in the community.

In 1 Corinthians 12, the apostle Paul uses the imagery of the body of Christ to describe the organizational structure of the church. Each member has a valuable contribution to make in the body. When we think of the human body, we recognize that the different members or parts of the body are organized into systems. Each member of the body does not function independently. The human body is made up of 11 systems vital to the effective functioning of the entire body. A few examples are the digestive system, the circulatory system, the nervous system, and the respiratory system. 

Picture the respiratory system as a small group with different members providing oxygen to the cells, including the nose, mouth, larynx, trachea, and bronchi. The respiratory system brings life through its air passages to the entire body. Can you begin to understand why the Holy Spirit impressed the apostle Paul to use the body as an illustration of the church? 

He states, “Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually” (1 Cor. 12:27, NKJV). Members, organized into small groups, each contributing their individual gifts to the whole, create a healthy environment for members to grow spiritually and for the church to grow numerically. When you think of the human body, every member has a function. There are no idle spectators. Each member of the body has a role to play. First Corinthians 12:20-22 makes this point emphatically clear. “But now indeed there are many members, yet one body. And the eye cannot say to the hand, ‘I have no need of you’; nor again the head to the feet, ‘I have no need of you.’ No, much rather, those members of the body which seem to be weaker are necessary” (NKJV).

Every member of the church is vitally important. Each one has been gifted for service within the body. Small groups become the vehicle that God uses to focus the witness of each member for the good of the entire body. These interrelated groups, with varying roles and responsibilities, provide the foundation of a healthy church. Involvement in a small group fosters Christian commitment, responsibility, and accountability. Christianity is not a solo act. We are Christians in community, contributing by using our gifts in and for the community.

Here are some practical examples in the book of Acts. In Acts 6, a problem arises within the church, regarding the feeding of the poor widows. There was a “murmuring” that the Greek speaking widows were being neglected in the daily distribution of food. This issue potentially could become so divisive that it might have torn apart the church. How was the problem solved? A small group called deacons was established to meet, seek the good of the body, and come up with a solution. As a result of the unified giftedness of these godly men, the problem was solved. Here is another example of the effectiveness of small groups in the book of Acts. In Acts 12, Peter was imprisoned by Herod. It appeared that Peter’s doom was sealed. The church formed a small home prayer group. Members earnestly sought God. Miraculously, Peter was delivered. Small groups of committed believers, praying, make an eternal difference.

In Acts 16, the apostle Paul organized a gospel-medical missionary team, including Luke and Paul’s young protégé, Timothy, to evangelize Greece. Churches established in Philippi, Thessalonica, and Corinth testify to the effectiveness of their work. Here are three kinds of small groups—the Acts 6 group that worked primarily within the church, the Acts 12 prayer group, and the Acts 16 evangelistic group. 

One of the things that we must be extremely careful about in the organization of small groups is thinking that every group must be the same. In the New Testament, there were different groups, meeting different needs, performing different ministries for the good of the whole.

Each group was involved in prayer, fellowship, the study of the Word, and service. But the forms, structure, and ministry of the group varied, based on the gifts of the members. Some groups were predominately care groups that ministered within the body of Christ, while other groups were predominately mission groups that focused on winning lost people to Christ. 

#### Part III: Life Application

In addition to our individual witness for Christ, small groups provide an opportunity for the blended gifts of each member to be used to their maximum capacity. Everyone is not called to do the same thing, but everyone is called to use the gifts God has given him or her. Small groups are an exciting way to get involved in church life. Here are a few of the various types of small groups to share with your class:

1.	Sabbath School Action Units: Adult Sabbath School classes meet to pray together, fellowship, share a meal, study the Word, and plan outreach activities. In some parts of the world, these Sabbath School action units are the very foundation for the growth of the church.
2.	Ministry Groups: Small groups of 6-12 church members with similar gifts and interests unite to accomplish a specific ministry task. An example might be a health ministry outreach of cooking schools, stress management seminars, lifestyle seminars etc. Other examples might be family-life ministry, youth ministry, Bible study ministry, or literature ministry in which the Holy Spirit leads members with similar interests to form a small group to use their gifts to reach out to the community.
3.	Nurture Groups: These are small groups of 6-12 church members whose primary purpose is to care for and strengthen the faith of existing church members. These groups often meet in homes for a three to six-month period to share one another’s joys and sorrows, struggles and triumphs as they pray, share, study the Word and fellowship together.

Here are three practical possibilities for you to become more actively involved for Christ: 

1. Have you ever thought of starting a small nurture group in your home? 
2. Is there a ministry group the Holy Spirit has been impressing you to become a member of? 
3. What would you think of our Sabbath School class becoming a Sabbath School action unit that meets once a month to pray, fellowship, study the Word, and plan a Sabbath School class mission activity?

In the New Testament Christian church, there were no spectators. So let’s get involved. We will grow in Christ, and others will be blessed, as we use our gifts in service in the context of a small group.
