**Key Text**: Ephesians 4:32

**Study Focus**: John 4:27-30, 2 Thessalonians 1:1-4, Romans 15:7, 1 Peter 3:15.

#### Part I: Overview

Our attitude toward others often determines their response toward us. Have you ever noticed that when you smile at someone they often smile back? Have you also noticed that when you respond with an unexpected compliment other people generally respond positively?

Jesus understood this fact of human nature. John’s Gospel states that Jesus is “the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the world” (John 1:9, NKJV). Deep within the fabric of our being is a longing for eternal truth. There is this aching void within for purpose and meaning. God has placed within every individual a longing to know God. When we approach people with the knowledge that, whether they know it or not, there is a hidden hunger in their souls to know God, we will approach them differently than if we think they are uninterested in spiritual things. 

In this week’s Sabbath School lesson, we will study how Jesus believed in people. We’ll examine His attitude toward even the ones that seemed the least interested in His message. We will review how He approached a Samaritan woman, a Jewish scribe, a Roman soldier, a Canaanite seeker, and a woman whose reputation was severely soiled. In each instance, Jesus looked for the best. He presented the truth but always in love. The foundation of His message was acceptance, forgiveness, grace, and the hope of a new life. Jesus never minimized the value of truth, but He always presented truth in redemptive ways. In this week’s lesson, we will discover how to apply Jesus’ methods in our witness today. 

#### Part II: Commentary

We have discussed the Samaritan woman at the well in a previous lesson. There is an aspect of Jesus’ discussion with the woman that is vital to our understanding of Jesus’ principles in faith-sharing that we did not examine previously. It is vital to understand this aspect of Jesus’ interaction with the woman. As the conversation between the two of them proceeds, the woman says to Jesus, “ ‘Sir, I perceive that You are a prophet. Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where one ought to worship’ ” (John 4:19, 20, NKJV). This was a critical issue between the Jews and Samaritans. It had to do with worship and the presence of God. Mount Gerizim became the main point of divergence between the Samaritans and the Jews. One of the Jewish sages raised this question then answered it. “At what point can the Samaritans be accepted into Judaism? When they reject their belief in Mount Gerizim.” Jesus could have entered very easily into a theological debate with this woman over authentic worship, but He looked beyond her intellectual questions and met her heart’s need. Her need was not to have all her religious questions answered. Her need was to find the acceptance, forgiveness, and the new life that only Jesus could give. As the result of this one woman’s conversion, all of Samaria was impacted. 

Jesus remained two days in this apparently unreachable place with these apparently unreachable people. The results were remarkable. John’s Gospel declares, “Many of the Samaritans of that city believed in Him because of the word of the woman who testified” (John 4:39, NKJV). Then John adds, “And many more believed because of His [Christ’s] own word” (John 4:41, NKJV). This was only the beginning of a spiritual harvest where the ground seemed barren. Samaria was ripe for the gospel, and when, a few years later, Philip preached, the record states that Samaria “received the word of God” (Acts 8:14).

What if Jesus would have entered into a religious argument with the Samaritan woman? Suppose they had spent their time in heated debate over where to worship? Jesus looked beyond her comments to her needs. Successful witnesses for God have a winsome disposition and a winning attitude. They see the best in others. 

Consider Christ’s interaction with a Canaanite woman. The Canaanites were an idolatrous people, often focusing on the veneration of the dead through their household gods. They also worshiped the heathen deities of Baal, El, Asherah, and Astarte. These so-called fertility cults were especially gods and goddesses of vegetation and the harvest. They often received grain and fruit offerings to win their favor. Many scholars believe that the Canaanites’ religious rites, at times, included human sacrifice, especially child sacrifice. 

If there was anyone whom a Jew would consider an outcast from God, untouchable and unwinnable, it would be a Canaanite woman. Jesus’ approach to this woman is both masterful and unconventional. In His divine wisdom, guided by the Holy Spirit, He reaches her in a way that seems almost contrary to His very nature. She earnestly appeals for the Savior to have mercy upon her and deliver her daughter from demon possession (Matt. 15:22). How does Jesus respond to this heartfelt appeal? Surprisingly, with silence. He seems to ignore her (Matt. 15:23). His disciples plead with Him to send her away, but she persists in supplicating Jesus for aid. Then He makes this astonishing statement: “ ‘I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel’ ” (Matt. 15:24, NKJV). This seems like discrimination. It appears Jesus has come only for a select few. The desperate woman does not take “no” for an answer. She appeals, “ ‘Lord, help me!’ ” (Matt. 15:25. NKJV). Jesus now appears to reject her totally, when He says, “ ‘It is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the little dogs’ ” (Matt. 15:26, NKJV). She tenaciously continues her appeal but “ ‘even the little dogs eat the crumbs which fall from the masters’ table’ ” (Matt. 15:27, NKJV). 

Jesus had a divine strategy in each of His responses. He was continually drawing her to deeper faith and revealing to His disciples the need of seeing the depth of faith in someone they would have turned away. Christ clearly said to this woman in the presence of the disciples, “ ‘O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire.’ And her daughter was healed from that very hour” (Matt. 15:28, NKJV). It is remarkable that Jesus saw what others did not see. He saw great faith in this Canaanite woman. Effective witnesses for Christ see the dawning of faith in the hearts of people in very unexpected places. 

Jesus agreed with people where He could, accepted them where they were, and affirmed them when He was able. He developed caring relationships with others, and it was in the context of these relationships that He planted the seeds of faith and shared divine truths. 

The basis of all acceptance is the gospel. Christ has accepted us, so we can accept others. We can forgive others because Christ has forgiven us. We can have mercy on others because Christ has mercy on us. Christ sees the best in us, so we can see the best in others. The apostle Paul states it best: “Therefore receive one another, just as Christ also received us, to the glory of God” (Rom. 15:7, NKJV). Elsewhere Paul says, “And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God in Christ forgave you” (Eph. 4:32, NKJV).

The law of kindness wins hearts. Tender heartedness, acceptance, and forgiveness open minds to the gospel. Treating others as Christ has treated us makes all the difference in our witness. Sometime ago a poverty-stricken woman wandered aimlessly down the street on a cold winter night. When she passed a Seventh-day Adventist church, she noticed the lights were on. She anxiously entered the fellowship hall, not having any idea what to expect. Life had been extremely hard for her. She recently had been through several traumatic experiences. 

A healthy cooking class was in progress. She found a seat in the back of the room and sat with her woolen cap pulled down over her head, bundled in her winter coat. She certainly was an oddity among the other more sophisticated women attending the class that night. Fortunately, some of the ladies reached out to her. They made her feel extremely welcome. They seemed to overlook her poverty and see her genuineness. They even overlooked the fact that she rummaged through the trash can looking for food when the class was over. They said little but tried to supply some of her needs. She continued to attend the class. Friendship developed a bond between some of the ladies and this unfortunate woman. As the weeks passed, impressed by the kindness, love, and acceptance, she began to attend church each week and followed through with Bible studies. 

Beneath the veneer, there was an intelligent and talented woman. As a child, she had taken piano lessons and become quite an accomplished pianist. Within two years, she was an active member of the church and one of its pianists. Seeing people not for what they are but for what they might become makes all the difference. Jesus had a winning attitude, and so can we.

#### Part III: Life Application

**Presenting the Truth in Love**

Friendship opens the door to hearts, but it does not usually win people to Christ without our intentional witness. Positive relationships create confidence but in and of themselves they do not win people if they are not Christ-centered relationships. Jesus is “the way, the truth, and the life” (John 14:6). Every biblical doctrine reveals the truth about Jesus so we through His power can live His life. The apostle Paul instructs us to speak “the truth in love” (Eph. 4:15).

**Invite your class to discuss the scenarios below:**

1.	A homeless man camps out in your church parking lot. He has been there for three nights. What are appropriate ways to relate to him and some not so appropriate ways? How can you be redemptive without turning the parking lot into a tent city for the homeless and negatively impacting the neighbors?
2.	A Catholic business associate has just lost a wife due to an extended bout with breast cancer. He is troubled that his wife may be suffering in purgatory. How can you present the truth about the state of the dead in a comforting way, in love, without offending him?
3.	A young couple you know well that are not Seventh-day Adventists have just lost a 12-year-old son in a car accident. How can you provide the hope of Christ’s return without trivializing the death of their son?

**Here are the principles of developing a winning attitude**:

1.	Ask Jesus to impress you that all people have spiritual longings and are winnable to Christ.
2.	Seek to develop positive Christ-centered relationships with those in your sphere of influence.
3.	Pray for opportunities to share divine truth.
4.	Present biblical truths in the context of loving relationships.
