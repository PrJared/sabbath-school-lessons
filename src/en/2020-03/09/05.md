`Read Romans 15:7 and Ephesians 4:32. How would you describe the foundation of all acceptance? What is the essence of an accepting attitude?`

In these two passages the apostle Paul presents the principles underlying our acceptance of one another. Because Christ has forgiven and accepted each one of us, can we possibly refuse to forgive and accept one another? In fact, it is precisely because Jesus has received us that we can receive one another, even despite the other’s flaws.

Think hard about what this means. Think about yourself and about some of the things you have done and might still be struggling with—things that, perhaps, you alone know about, things that you’d be terrified if others knew about, too.

And yet, what? By faith, you are accepted in Christ, who knows all about the things that others might not know anything about. Yes, He knows all of that, and yet, He accepts you anyway, not because of your own goodness, but because of His.

What, then, should be your attitude toward others?

Here is a difficult concept for some to understand. Genuine acceptance means that we accept people as they are, with all their sinful habits, because they are human beings created in the image of God. Because Christ died for us “while we were yet sinners” and “reconciled [us] to God” when we were His enemies, we can forgive and accept others. His love toward us becomes the very foundation of our acceptance and forgiveness toward others (Rom. 5:6–10).

But once an accepting, caring relationship has been established, it is often necessary to confront another individual lovingly with the truths of Scripture. To fail to do this is to neglect to love. As friends, we care enough to share life-changing, eternal truths with our friends.

Jesus’ attitude was not, “Do whatever you please. It’s all right. I still accept you.” His attitude was, rather, “No matter what you have done, I am willing to forgive you and provide you with power to change.” Biblical truth presented humbly in Christ’s spirit with a loving attitude wins hearts and changes lives.

`How is it possible to accept an individual without accepting that person’s sinful behavior? How can we be accepting while at the same time not condone or tolerate sin?`
