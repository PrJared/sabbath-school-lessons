The epicenter of Revelation is chapter 14. This chapter is of paramount importance to God’s people living in the last days of human history. It unfolds God’s last- day message to humankind. This end-time message is crucial to the people of God and to all humanity.

`Read Revelation 14:14–20. What symbolism is used here to picture the return of our Lord?`

The symbolism of the harvest is used throughout the Bible to describe Christ’s return (Matt. 13:37–43, Mark 4:29). In Revelation 14, the harvest of ripe grain represents the redemption of the righteous, and the harvest of overripe grapes depicts the destruction of the wicked. Revelation 14:6–12 contains an urgent last-day message to prepare men and women for earth’s final harvest.

`Read Revelation 14:6, 7. What is the essence of the message found in these two verses? How do they help us understand who we are as Seventh-day Adventists?`

The message of the first angel in Revelation 14 appeals to a 21st-century generation longing for purpose in their lives. It presents the gospel of God’s grace that provides forgiveness for all. It cleanses us from the guilt of sin and gives us power to be overcomers. This message provides the basis for all self-worth in the fact that Christ created us and redeemed us. It points out that one day all injustice will come to an end in God’s final judgment. It is incredibly good news because it reveals that unrighteousness will not last forever.

`“In a special sense Seventh-day Adventists have been set in the world as watchmen and light-bearers. To them has been entrusted the last warning for a perishing world. On them is shining wonderful light from the Word of God. They have been given a work of the most solemn import—the proclamation of the first, second, and third angels’ messages. There is no other work of so great importance. They are to allow nothing else to absorb their attention.”—Ellen. G. White, Evangelism, pp. 119, 120. As a church, but even more important, as individuals, how can we take these words to heart?`
