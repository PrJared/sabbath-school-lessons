The gospels primarily center on Christ’s first coming. They tell the story of His birth, His life and ministry, and His death and resurrection. Although they speak of His second coming, that is not their main emphasis. The book of Revelation’s primary focus, however, is the climax of the centuries-long conflict of the ages. Each of its major prophecies ends in the glorious return of our Lord.

`Read Revelation 1:7, Revelation 11:15, Revelation 14:14–20, and Revelation 19:11–18. What similar conclusion do you see in each of these passages?`

From the first to the last chapter of the book of Revelation, the climax of each prophecy is the coming of Jesus. The “Lamb who was slain” (Rev. 5:12, NKJV). is coming again as King of kings and Lord of lords (Rev. 19:16). He will defeat all of the foes that oppress and persecute His people (Rev. 17:14). He will deliver them from this nightmare of sin and bring them home to glory. The great controversy between good and evil will be ended. The earth will be made new, and the redeemed will live with their Lord forever (Rev. 21:1–4).

In Revelation 22:7 (see also vs. 12, 17 and 20), Jesus says: “ ‘Behold, I am coming quickly! Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book’ ” (NKJV). Thus, Jesus’ final appeal to all humanity is to respond to His love, accept His grace, and follow His truth to be ready for His soon return. Revelation concludes with Jesus’ invitation, “And the Spirit and the bride say, ‘Come!’ And let Him who hears say, ‘Come!’” (Rev. 22:17, NKJV).

Our Lord invites all of those who seek for eternal life to come to Him. He then invites those of us who have accepted the message of salvation and are eagerly anticipating His return to join Him in inviting others to accept the message of His love. He sends us out on His mission to share His message to prepare a world for His soon return. There is nothing more rewarding than participating with Jesus in His mission to the world. There is nothing more fulfilling than cooperating with Christ in His last-day plan of salvation.

`Christ, coming quickly? John wrote those words about 2,000 years ago. However, given our understanding of the state of the dead, why is Christ’s second coming, for each one of us in our own personal experience, never more than an instant after our death? How does this fact help us understand how quickly, indeed, Christ is coming?`
