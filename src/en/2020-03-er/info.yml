  title: "Making Friends for Jesus"
  description: "Sometimes we understand just one idea, and that changes everything. Many years ago, I sat in a leadership meeting with other church leaders. We talked about sharing our faith with people, witnessing, and preaching the Good News about Jesus. One of my friends said, “The work we do for God is really God’s work, not ours. God uses all of the treasures in heaven to save our planet. Our job is to work together with Him to save lost people.” When I heard that, I felt my heart become light. It was not my job to save this lost planet. It was God’s job. I was responsible for working with Him in what He already was doing."
