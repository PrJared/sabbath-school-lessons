The book of Acts often is named “The Acts of the Holy Spirit.” That is because Acts shows us the stories of believers who are filled with the Holy Spirit. These people give their lives to God. The Spirit helps them change the lives of other people for the better. Acts is an exciting book. It shows us the church sharing the Good News. We also see how fast the church grows. The New Testament church depends fully on the Holy Spirit. The Spirit does miracles and wonderful things in the church. The church is an example of what the Holy Spirit can do in the lives of men and women who fully serve Jesus.

`Read Acts 2:41, 42; Acts 4:4, 31; Acts 5:14, 42; Acts 6:7; and Acts 16:5. What is the most powerful part of these verses? Or what touches your heart the most? Luke wrote the books of Acts. In this list of verses, Luke talks about how fast the church grows. Why do you think Luke tells us about that? What message is Luke trying to share with us?`

Why does Luke write the book of Acts? Because Luke wants each reader to know about the work that the Holy Spirit does in the New Testament Church.

Do you also see that Luke tells us how many people are baptized? Luke tells us these numbers because he wants to measure the Holy Spirit’s work in the 1st century. In Acts 2:41, Luke tells us that 3,000 people are baptized in one day and in one place. In Acts 4:4, Luke tells us that 5,000 men are baptized. In Acts 5:14, large crowds of people accept the Lord and are baptized.

Luke tells us stories about other men and women who are baptized too. There is Lydia, a business owner. A Philippian prison guard. A girl who was filled with demons. And an Ethiopian man. In each story, Luke shows us how the Holy Spirit touches people’s hearts. We also see that the big crowds are made of men and women. Each man or woman is a child of God. Jesus died for each one. Yes, we like big numbers. They make us feel that we are a success. But in the end, sharing the truth is more often about our winning one person to Jesus at a time.

The New Testament believers also started many churches. This helped the church grow fast. The new churches helped the whole New Testament church grow in spiritual strength too. This is an important lesson for us.
