> <p>Memory Verse</p>
> “After they prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit. They were bold when they spoke God’s word [message]” (Acts 4:31, NIrV).

JESUS TELLS HIS FOLLOWERS to “ ‘Go everywhere in the world [on the earth]. Tell the Good News to everyone’ ” (Mark 16:15, ERV). Jesus’ followers must think that this job is impossible! How can they do it? They are only a small group. They have very little money. Most of them do not have an education. They are only ordinary people. But they have a God who is more than ordinary. He can give them the power to do the impossible!

Jesus says, “ ‘But you will receive [get] power when the Holy Spirit comes on you. Then you will tell people about me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria. And you will even tell other people about me from one end [part]of the earth to the other [part]’ ” (Acts 1:8, NIrV). The Holy Spirit will help them to share the message about the Cross. Then Jesus’ followers will preach with power. Their message will change lives. Paul tells us that the Good News was “told to everyone on earth” (Colossians 1:23, ERV). In this week’s lesson, we will look at the work that the Holy Spirit does to make us powerful witnesses for Jesus.
