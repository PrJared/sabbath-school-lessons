Ephesians 2:1–3; 1 John 1:1–4; Mark 5:18–20; Hebrews 10:19–22; Galatians 2:20.

> <p>Memory Verse</p>
> “I write this letter to you who believe in the Son of God. I write so that you will know that you have eternal life now” (1 John 5:13, ERV).

AS WE SAID ALREADY, the most powerful proof for the Good News is a changed life. People may argue with your beliefs. They may disagree with your Bible teachings. They may say that you do not understand the Bible. But who can argue with your personal story about what Jesus means to you and what He has done in your life?

Witnessing is sharing what we know about Jesus. Witnessing is letting other people know what Jesus means to us and what He has done for us. Some people think that witnessing is only about trying to prove what they believe is right and show that other people’s beliefs are wrong. But if we talk about Bible truth that way, we will not win many people to Jesus. Our sharing about Jesus must come from a heart that has been changed by His mercy and forgiveness, His love and His truth. Then other people will see how the truth we believe has changed our lives. That is the best reason why we must live what we believe.

We must show that every Bible teaching is about Jesus and shows His love too. Then people will want to accept what the Bible says.
