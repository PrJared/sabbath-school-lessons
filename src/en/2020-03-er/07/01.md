> “ ‘In the same way, my words leave my mouth, and they don’t come back without results [success]. My words make the things happen that I want to happen. They succeed in doing what I send them to do’ ” (Isaiah 55:11, ERV).

WE TALK ABOUT JESUS when we tell people what they must do to be saved. But how can we expect to know anything about Jesus without the Bible? Without the Bible, how can we know anything about the worldwide war between good and evil? Or God’s love? Or Jesus’ life and death? Or the Second Coming?

Nature shows us God’s power and beauty. But it does not show us God’s plan to save us. We learn about God’s saving plan from Jesus. Jesus “is the true light that gives light to all people” (John 1:9, ERV). Even so, we need the Bible to explain fully God’s truth. The Bible is God’s Word. It gives us the best understanding about Jesus. Jesus is the Living Word. Without the Bible, the Holy Spirit is limited in what He can show our hearts about Jesus.

Jesus says, “ ‘You study the Scriptures [Bible] carefully. You study them because you think they will give you eternal [everlasting] life. The Scriptures you study are a witness [proof] about me’ ” (John 5:39, NIrV). Every Bible teaching shows us what is in Jesus’ heart. We share Bible truth so that we can show people the love of Jesus.
