`Concerning the individuals in the inTro stories, were they following God’s will or not?`

`How is Elijah’s following of God’s Word similar to our following of God’s Word? How is it different?`

`How have you applied the principles of God’s Word to a major life decision?`

`What is an example of where a principle was extracted from a passage?`

`What are some supposed sources of God’s will that are dangerous to our spiritual walk?`

`Why is it so easy to lose sight of the forest for the trees (or, lose sight of Christ for His will)?`

`Why is studying the Bible day by day so difficult? How do we endure the absence of immediate results?`
