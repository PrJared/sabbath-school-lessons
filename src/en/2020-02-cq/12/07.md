`What does a horizontally unbalanced church look like? What does a vertically unbalanced church look like? Which is your church?`

`To attract more attendees, how are some churches sacrificing biblical principles? To project faithfulness, how are some churches sacrificing the appeal, charm, and invitation of Christ to people?`

`Why do you go to your church? If you don’t go, why not—seriously?`

`Which of the five elements are strong in your worship service? Which of them are weakest? Do you experience Christ as Lord, King, Savior, and God in your worship service?`

`How are you trained more effectively as a disciple of Christ through your local church?`
