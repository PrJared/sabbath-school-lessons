`How does one discover what is central in one’s life?`

`What is it that is central in your life?`

`How does one make their needs peripheral and God’s kingdom central?`

`What are examples of modern rust? Modern moths? Modern thieves?`

`What are different ways of making God last?`

`How do we make God best in our decision making?`

`What are new revelations of God’s will to you?`

`Are we the happiest people in the world? Why or why not?`
