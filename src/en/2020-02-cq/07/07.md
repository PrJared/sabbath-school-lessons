`For a new church member, what are the challenges of making friends? How can these challenges be overcome?`

`How do you share the Word of God with your friends without pushing them away?`

`Jesus was, in practical terms, “a friend of sinners,” yet His good morals were not corrupted. How can you witness to unbelievers and not be led astray?`

`Does friendship metamorphose as it goes through different seasons of life (college, marriage, and so on)? How do you manage the changes?`
