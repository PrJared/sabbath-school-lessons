Read This Week’s Passage: 1 Samuel 1:4–20

That Child Too

Scripture informs us that children are a heritage of the Lord (Ps. 127:3–5, KJV). The preposition “of” either denotes origin or destination—that is, children are a heritage given to us by God, and they are equally a heritage we return to God.

Just as an inheritance is not a result of one’s toil or labor, so children are not, as is often considered to be the case, the fruit of parents’ power and ability or a mere natural result of the coming together of a man and a woman. Children are a gift from God Himself!

Including the child born out of wedlock? Yes, even that child. And the child conceived in violence? That child too! Every child that is born is a blessing from God. What of the child who comes at an inconvenient time—when the parents are financially or emotionally unprepared? Or the child born with a disability? Even these children, the text affirms, are a gift.

Not only are children a gift from God, but when they are raised in the fear of the Lord, they are a gift returned to God. Parents may educate their children to be a force for good in an increasingly wicked world.
