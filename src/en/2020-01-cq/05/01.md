Read This Week’s Passage: Daniel 5

Characteristic to Avoid

Accountability is a word that brings with it feelings of fear and dread. This word is typically not used in positive terms. However, imagine a world without accountability. What if our judges were not held accountable to uphold the law? Or our police to enforce the law? Or our bankers were not held accountable to be honest? Without accountability there is no trust, and without trust there is no relationship.

Daniel 5 is a story of a king’s accountability. More than that, it is the story of end-time accountability. It is the story of a king who squandered the opportunities and the light that had been given to him. Out of the eight stories in Daniel, this is the second narrative that reveals characteristics that we are to avoid as the prophecies are being fulfilled.
