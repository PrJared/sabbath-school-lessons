Michael literally means one “who is as God.” There are several clues to Michael’s identity throughout Scripture. In the book of Daniel, Michael is associated with the raising of the dead from the grave. Here are biblical clues to the identity of Michael:

`Michael is the archangel—Jude 9`

`The voice of the archangel raises the dead—1 Thess. 4:16`

`The voice of Jesus raises the dead—John 5:25–29`

From these verses we see that Michael, the archangel who raises the dead, is Jesus.

In the Old Testament we find instances where “the angel of the Lord” appears to men. For instance, an angel appears to Manoah and his wife to tell them that they will have a son. When they ask the angel what his name is, he responds, “ ‘Why do you ask My name, seeing it is wonderful?’ ” (Judg. 13:18). The clue to the angel’s identity is that Jesus’ name is also “Wonderful” (Isa. 9:6). After the angel of the Lord left, they said, “ ‘We shall surely die, because we have seen God!’ ” (Judg. 13:22).

The word angel means messenger. Jesus appeared in the form of an angel to bring special messages to His people. In the case of Daniel, it was Michael who came to the aid of Gabriel to answer his prayer.
