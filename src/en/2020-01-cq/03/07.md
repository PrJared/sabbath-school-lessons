`What are you willing to die for?`

`What do you think were the motivations for why you made your stand?`

`Would you die for someone that you love? Does love change one’s perspective of death?`

`What does standing for God even in the face of death reveal about God’s perspective of death?`

`Why do you think God asks us to be willing to die for Him rather than compromise principle?`

`What are ways that we can keep a consciousness of God ever before us?`

`What are ways that we can get to the place where God’s opinion matters most?`
