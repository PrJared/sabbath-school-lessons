In John 14:29, Jesus points out one purpose of predictive prophecy: “And now I have told you before it comes, that when it does come to pass, you may believe.” In other words, predictive prophecy is evidence that appeals to reason. The prophecy is predicted and it happens. This is evidence in favor of the trustworthiness of Scripture. Is there still room to doubt? Sure there is. However, this is true for any proposition. Jesus gives us prophecy so that we can have evidence on which to base our belief. When it comes to our doubts, we are called to have faith based on the evidence given; one of those evidences being predictive prophecy.

In John 13:19, Jesus gives the main purpose of predictive prophecy: “Now I tell you before it comes, that when it does come to pass, you may believe that I am He.” The purpose of prophecy is to lead one to the Person of prophecy, Jesus Christ. Prophecy leads us to the God whose mind knows the future and, in His infinite love, has chosen to reveal the future before it happens so that we may come to be intrigued with wonder, awe, and love with the God of prophecy.

Prophecy establishes our trust in God’s Word and introduces us to the God of prophecy. Prophecy is intellectual, and it is relational. Prophecy appeals to the mind and heart. Predictive prophecy appeals to our reason and appeals to our heart’s yearning for God.
