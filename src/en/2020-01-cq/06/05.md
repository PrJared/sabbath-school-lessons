Relationships are built on quality time. Think of people who are dating; time together is the entity most sought after—it is made the highest priority. In fact, a couple that does not spend time together will grow apart. The difference between a friend and an acquaintance is closely related to the amount of voluntary time they spend together. If we are serious about our relationships, we will be intentional about spending time together. Time together provides an opportunity for shared experiences, conversation, and the building of memories.

Our relationship with God is also built on time. God considers time such an important factor in our relationship with Him that He established the Sabbath immediately after creating human beings. The Sabbath is a cyclical occurrence that makes our relationship with God the priority of our week. Our daily devotions are a cyclical occurrence that makes our relationship with God the priority of our day.

Our relationship with God can be difficult to define—it can be thought of as an ethereal, nebulous thing. However, the notion of time and relationship puts our relationship with God into tangible terms. In other words, no time with God = no relationship with God. It’s a startling reality to reflect upon, but God is always eagerly waiting to spend time with us and will receive us regardless of our track record.
