`Why do you think 40 percent of converts leave the church?`

`What can you do to help plug this leak?`

`Why do “unripe harvest” and “members only” evangelistic strategies exist in the church?`

`What does intentional and systematic discipleship look like in your life? In your personal ministry? In your church?`

`Why isn’t every member trained in discipleship in the church immediately after baptism?`

`How does following Jesus’ model for ministry help with the current dearth of discipleship today?`

`Where does discipleship fit the lost pattern of Luke 15?`

`Are you being directly trained as a disciple by Jesus today? How are you training someone else today in the footsteps of Jesus?`
