`How is planting different from preparation?`

`Why do some mock the form of distributing Christian literature and tracts? How can this form be improved?`

`Besides literature, what are other forms for planting?`

`What is preventing you and your church from being more active seed planters?`

`What are ways to engage media ministry more in the discipleship process?`

`How can we be more like Christ in the art of conversation and listening?`

`How can we maintain sincerity, authenticity, and realness in our Christian discipleship?`

`When and where will you plant next?`
