`Which is more difficult: water coming in or water going out?`

`Why is an attitude of service not seen more in the church and in society?`

`How have you seen the Holy Spirit move spatially, socially, and opportunistically?`

`How can Jesus more powerfully be the focus of our Bible studies?`

`In what ways can you co-labor and be yoked with Christ?`

`How often do you exercise physically? How often do you exercise spiritually?`

`Why is it difficult to make the kingdom of God our first priority?`

`What takes up your time? What affects your relationships with your friends, family, and community? Why are you working toward the goals you have currently chosen? Where is Jesus in any of these questions?`
