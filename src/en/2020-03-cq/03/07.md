`How can prayer become dangerous when only persistent?`

`What are assumptions that we make about prayer that make it inert?`

`How would one diagnose a lack of air/prayer in the spiritual life?`

`How many of your prayers have been based on promises that God has given through Scripture?How many of them were answered? How many of them do you remember?`

`How close are you with the Holy Spirit in prayer?`

`What’s the longest you’ve held your breath spiritually?`
