#### Running for God

_By Marian Kazmierczak_

Running brought me to church in Poland. As a young man, I started bodybuilding because the doctor cautioned me to take measures to improve my health.

Then I got into long-distance running. I loved it! I ran marathons, 62-mile (100-kilometer) races, and even a 24-hour run over 126 miles (203 kilometers).

I joined a group of runners who trained together several times a week.

After a while, I noticed that Piotr, a runner in our group, missed our training sessions every Saturday. I couldn’t understand why, and I finally asked him.

“I’ve been thinking about the meaning of life”, Piotr replied. “I’ve been reading the Bible, and I’ve been going to several churches to find one that follows the Bible. Now I’ve found such a church. Would you like to study the Bible with us?”

The Bible studies led by a Seventh-day Adventist pastor confused me. I considered myself to be a devout Christian, and I belonged to another denomination.

One day while we were running, Piotr shocked me with a question.

“Did you know that your clergy aren’t telling you the truth?” he said.

“Now you have gone too far!” I exclaimed. “You’re mixed up”.

“The next time we meet, I’ll bring a Bible”, Piotr said. “You bring your church’s book of doctrines. We’ll see where the truth lies”.

The proposal seemed good to me. I had always tried to live a truthful life and to follow the truth that I knew. At our next meeting, Piotr and I compared the two books. I was stunned to realize that my book didn’t match the teachings of the Bible. Several months later, I was baptized. I was 45.

It felt good to join a church whose members, just like me, cared about their health. Soon I noticed that several church members didn’t eat meat. I researched the plant-based diet and also quit eating meat. Before, I saw my body as my own and exploited it for my own desires. Now I understand that my body is not my own. I try not to damage it. It is God’s temple.

Today at the age of 71, running remains a major part of my life, although I have stopped training and competing on Sabbath. Running is an ideal way to spread the gospel. After a marathon, everyone feels good about their accomplishments, and it is easy to talk about God. I share who gives me strength to run at my age.

I run at least three times a week, 6 miles (10 kilometers) each time. It takes me about 55 minutes. I run in forests and in nature. I think about my life and think about God. I hum hymns and remember Bible verses. I pray for God to bring someone into my path so I can talk about Him. He brings people to me.

Thank you for your Thirteenth Sabbath Offering in 2017 that helped build a television studio for Hope Channel in Poland, broadcasting the gospel to the Polish-speaking world.
