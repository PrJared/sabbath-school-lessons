#### Part I: Overview 

Sometimes people say that they take the Bible just as it reads, without any need for interpretation. While it is laudable to take the Bible seriously and to be willing to follow what it commands us to do, no one approaches the Bible with a blank mind. We all are influenced in our thinking and understanding by our education, family, the culture we grew up in, and by our experience. We all have some presuppositions with which we approach the text. The reading and study of the biblical text inevitably involves some interpretation. The Bible was written in languages (Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic) that many of us did not grow up with or are only rudimentarily acquainted with. And as any translator knows, every translation into another language involves some form of interpretation. You must know a language really well in order to understand some of its subtleties or when irony is at work. Furthermore, our thinking is darkened by sin and thus not neutral when it comes to spiritual things. The very fact that different churches and denominations exist, even though they all claim to live by the Bible, demonstrates that some form of interpretation is at work in all of us. Yet, we study the same Book and can reach conclusions that unite us, despite all of the above differences. Interpretation is essential to understanding, and this week we will study some methods of interpretation that will guide our Bible study.

#### Part II: Commentary  

The meaning of a sentence is not determined just by the individual words that are used but by the context in which those words are employed. If we do not adequately take into consideration the immediate and wider literary context of a statement and how it uses the words in this circumstance, we quickly will come to wrong conclusions. Similarly, we need to take into consideration the historical background of what is written. It helps us to situate the text. Any text without a context quickly becomes a pretext for one’s own opinion. If we ignore the context, we will soon read something into the text that the writer actually did not intend to convey. We call this eisegesis. But rather than reading something into the text that is not there, we should do a thorough exegesis. That is, we should read out of the text that which the text actually states. Seventh-day Adventists want to follow nothing but the Bible. We do not have a pope or a teaching tradition that determines the definite meaning of Scripture. Thus, a careful and sound interpretation of the Bible is crucial for our theology and mission. It shapes our theological identity and beliefs.

**Presuppositions and Worldviews**

Every person holds a number of beliefs that we consciously or unconsciously presuppose. We assume them to be true, even though we cannot absolutely prove them. These most basic convictions about the world and our values are described in what is called worldview. Our worldview determines what is important for us and what is not. It filters our perception and interpretation of reality and provides a model of the world that guides us to live in the world. Our worldview encompasses our understanding of God, of human nature, of morality and truth. A worldview is made up of beliefs and answers to questions in these areas. Our worldview is influenced by our parents, our education, our peers, our experiences, the media, culture, and religion. We use our worldview every day and perceive and interpret reality through it. It influences our thinking and also our actions and behavior. 

**Think**

Think about different aspects in which our worldview impacts our thinking and behavior. Share with the members of the class the challenges that arise when different worldviews collide.

As long as we remain teachable, our worldview develops. When learning and growing radically alters many of our core beliefs, or when we have a conversion experience, our worldview can change. This change usually takes place when the previous worldview has been shown to be untruthful. After such a change, the person will continue to make adjustments and will try to bring other beliefs in line with the rest of his or her core beliefs. A conversion to Jesus does not automatically wipe out years of previous education. But it does involve a change from one worldview to another and a harmonizing of all one’s beliefs with the Bible.

**Think**

Read Luke 24:36–49. How did the experience of the risen Christ and His explanation of Scripture change His disciples’ view of reality? Share how your conversion experience has impacted your understanding of the Bible. If we only gradually bring all of our previous beliefs into harmony with Scripture, what does that tell us about how we should deal with others who are growing in their understanding?

**Translation and Interpretation**

If you want to interpret the Bible correctly, it is helpful to study the Bible in the original languages in which it was written. If that is not possible, use a translation that is following the original languages closely. Such a formal translation emphasizes word-for-word equivalency in the translation process and gives a more exact and literal rendering of the biblical languages. When we study and compare how certain words are actually used in various contexts by the Bible writers, the Bible itself can reveal its meaning. While such a formal translation makes an excellent study Bible, its readings are more wooden and stilted. In contrast to formal translations, there are dynamic translations that emphasize meaning-for-meaning instead of word-for-word equivalence. Here the translation is restructured into idiomatic usage that represents the equivalent thought or meaning in our language. While such translations are very readable, the interpretation may be misleading or erroneous. Finally, there are paraphrase translations. They are far freer with the original languages than are dynamic translations. Because a paraphrase is more interpretation than translation, it is not well suited for serious Bible study.

**Think**

If different Bible translations are available in your language, show them in your Sabbath School group and give examples of the different translations of a Bible passage. Do it in such a way that listeners are strengthened in their faith and encouraged to study the Bible more seriously for themselves. Recommend a trusted Bible translation in your language for Bible study.

Some denominations issue their own authorized Bible translation. The Seventh-day Adventist Church has not done so but uses established translations that are available through Bible Societies. Some Adventists have worked with Bible Societies to help make the Bible available to those who don’t have one and have made valuable contributions for various Bible translations. Think about ways you can help in the promotion, distribution, and study of the Bible.

**The Bible and Culture**

A knowledge of Near Eastern culture can be helpful for understanding some biblical passages. Read the passage in “Methods of Bible Study,” section 4.8.P. for some illustrations (see https://www.adventistbiblicalresearch.org/materials/bible-interpretation-hermeneutics/methods-bible-study). Today critical scholars maintain that the Bible is culturally conditioned, i.e., it reflects the culture in which it originated and thus is restricted in its authority because it is limited to a certain cultural setting, they say. While the Bible indeed was written in a particular culture, “the biblical writers insist that the theological message of Scripture is not culture-bound, applicable for only a certain people and a certain time, but permanent and universally applicable.”—Richard M. Davidson, “Biblical Interpretation” in Handbook of Seventh-day Adventist Theology, ed. Raoul Dederen (Hagerstown, MD: Review and Herald, 2000), p. 85. Jesus was born in a particular culture, and yet, He is not just the Savior for the people in His time. He is the Savior of the world. His coming into a particular culture does not make Him culturally relative but gives Him a significance that transcends every culture. 

**Think**

Some people just focus on those things that differ from culture to culture and thereby quickly lose sight of the commonalities that exist in all human beings across cultures. What basic aspects of human existence and human desires are present in all cultures? How does God’s spiritual answer to these aspects transcend any particular culture and speak to all human beings? How can you help to make the Bible’s message applicable to the people in your culture? Where can culture become a hinderance for the acceptance of the Bible’s message?

Our Sinful, Fallen Nature and Biblical Interpretation

Besides all of the above-mentioned aspects that show why interpretation is necessary, there is another factor that is often overlooked. It has to do with the consequences of our sinful, fallen nature. Read Ephesians 4:17, 18 and reflect on what Paul writes there. Here Paul describes some consequences that have arisen because of the blindness of our hearts and the futility of our minds. Sometimes even our understanding and interpretation of Scripture is tainted and dimmed because of our sin. Sometimes we do not follow the things of the Bible because we fear the pressure of our peers or the scorn of our relatives and friends. That is why we need the help of the Holy Spirit to enlighten our minds and to make us willing to follow what we have discovered.

#### Part III: Life Application

A person has heard the biblical truth. The reading of Scripture has provided a new perspective that God is real and alive and that living the Bible’s message is worthwhile. However, when some prayers are not answered as hoped for and the health of a child is in jeopardy, this person resorts to the traditional sources of healing that are customary in his or her culture. These traditional sources of healing are mediated through powerful witch doctors in the community.

`Think about similar tendencies and temptations that you face when your biblical faith is challenged. In what areas are you tempted to trust your received education or your parental upbringing or your experience more than the truth of the Bible?` 

`Some people who are trained in western philosophy and critical thinking believe that there is no supernatural being that can intervene in history or do miracles. Their closed worldview prevents them from accepting many supernatural stories in the Bible as real. Where does your worldview influence your interpretation of Scripture?`

`A person who is new in the faith wants to study the Bible more thoroughly. What Bible translation could you recommend for this task?`

`Why is faith important for a proper understanding of Scripture? What is the role of faith in the process of interpretation?`
