The variety of authors, their locations, and their backgrounds provide a unique testimony that God works to communicate history and His message to people as culturally diverse as its intended audience.

`What do the following texts tell us about the biblical writers and their backgrounds? (Exod. 2:10, Amos 7:14, Jer. 1:1–6, Dan. 6:1–5, Matt. 9:9, Phil. 3:3–6, Rev. 1:9).`

The Bible was written by people from many different kinds of backgrounds and in various circumstances. Some were writing from palaces, others from prisons, some in exile, and still others during their missionary journeys to share the gospel. These men had different education and occupations. Some, like Moses, were destined to be kings or, like Daniel, to serve in high positions. Others were simple shepherds. Some were very young and others quite old. Despite these differences, they all had one thing in common: they were called by God and inspired by the Holy Spirit to write messages for His people, no matter when or where they lived.

Also, some of the writers were eyewitnesses to the events they recounted. Others made careful personal investigation of events or careful use of existing documents (Josh. 10:13, Luke 1:1–3). But all parts of the Bible are inspired (2 Tim. 3:16). This is the reason why Paul states that “whatever was written . . . was written for our instruction, so that through . . . the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope” (Rom. 15:4, NASB). The God who created human language enables chosen people to communicate inspired thought in a trustworthy and reliable manner in human words.

“God has been pleased to communicate His truth to the world by human agencies, and He Himself, by His Holy Spirit, qualified men and enabled them to do His work. He guided the mind in the selection of what to speak and what to write. The treasure was entrusted to earthen vessels, yet it is, none the less, from Heaven.”—Ellen G. White, Selected Messages, book 1, p. 26.

`There were so many different writers, in so many different contexts, and yet the same God is revealed by them all. How does this amazing truth help confirm for us the veracity of God’s Word?`
