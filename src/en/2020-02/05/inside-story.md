#### Road to Jesus

_By Antonis Matsoukaros_

I grew up in Cyprus, a Christian country. But my family was only nominally Christian.

When I was 12, I became sick, and no doctor could make we well. So, I began to seek God. I visited various churches in hope of finding healing. I bowed before images and lit candles, thinking my actions would convince God to help me. But it didn’t work.

Many years later, when I was 30, I found a leaflet under my door advertising a series of lectures on archeological and spiritual matters in a public hall. The topic for each night was listed. Although I didn’t know it at the time, the meetings were organized by the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

I was not interested. But one topic, about midway through the list of topics, caught my attention: “The Antichrist and the Number 666”. I decided to attend that one lecture.

The lively presentation intrigued me, and I ended up attending the remaining meetings. At the conclusion, the organizers invited attendees to worship at a Seventh-day Adventist church.

I began attending regularly and eventually became convicted about the Advent message. But I hesitated about baptism. Nicosia is a fairly small city, and society is fairly close knit, so I wondered how my friends and family would react if they discovered that I had abandoned my childhood church to become a Seventh-day Adventist.

For 10 years, I pondered whether it was important to be baptized. Would it make me a better person? Was I ready to follow this church and its lifestyle?

The pastor was very patient. Over time we became good friends. After some gentle encouragement, I was baptized.

I have never regretted that decision.

Several years have passed since that beautiful day. Today I am 55 and active in our small church family. I teach the Sabbath School and have worked with a new pastor to build a website to reach the people of Cyprus.

Jesus is coming soon and, when He does, I will finally be healed of my lingering illness. Even more important, we want the people of Cyprus and around the world to know and be ready.

Part of the Thirteenth Sabbath Offering this quarter will help construct a new church building and community center in Nicosia for Antonis’ congregation and two other congregations. Thank you for planning a generous offering.
