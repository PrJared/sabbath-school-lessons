> “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men” (John 1:1–4, NKJV).

The first chapters of Genesis are foundational for the rest of Scripture. The major teachings or doctrines of the Bible have their source in these chapters. Here we find the nature of the Godhead working in harmony as the Father, Son (John 1:1–3; Heb. 1:1, 2), and the Spirit (Gen. 1:2) to create the world and all that is in it, culminating in humanity (Gen. 1:26–28). Genesis also introduces us to the Sabbath (Gen. 2:1–3), the origin of evil (Genesis 3), the Messiah and the plan of redemption (Gen. 3:15), the worldwide, universal flood (Genesis 6–9), the covenant (Gen. 1:28; Gen. 2:2, 3, 15–17; Gen. 9:9–17; Genesis 15), the dispersal of languages and people (Genesis 10, Genesis 11), and the genealogies that provide the framework for biblical chronology from Creation to Abraham (Genesis 5, Genesis 11). Finally, the power of God’s spoken Word (Gen. 1:3, 2 Tim. 3:16, John 17:17), the nature of humanity (Gen. 1:26–28), God’s character (Matt. 10:29, 30), marriage between a man and a woman (Gen. 1:27, 28; Gen. 2:18, 21–25), stewardship of the earth and its resources (Gen. 1:26; Gen. 2:15, 19), and the promised hope of a new creation (Isa. 65:17, Isa. 66:22, Rev. 21:1) are all based on these first chapters, which will be our study this week and next.
