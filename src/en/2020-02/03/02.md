The baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist marked the beginning of the Savior’s ministry, following which Jesus was led by the Spirit into the Judean wilderness, where—in His weakest human condition—He was tempted by Satan.

`Read Matthew 4:1–11. How does Jesus defend Himself against Satan’s temptations in the wilderness? What should we learn about the Bible from this account?`

When tempted by appetite, Jesus responds: “ ‘It is written, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God” ’ ” (Matt. 4:4, NKJV). Jesus points back to the living Word and its ultimate, divine source. In this way, He affirms the authority of Scripture. When tempted with the world’s kingdoms and glory, Jesus responds, “ ‘It is written, “You shall worship the Lord your God and Him only you shall serve” ’ ” (Matt. 4:10, Luke 4:8, NKJV). Christ reminds us that true worship is focused on God and not on anyone else, and that submission to His Word is true worship. Finally, with the temptation on the love of display and on presumption, Jesus responds, “ ‘It is written again, “You shall not tempt the Lord your God” ’ ” (Matt. 4:7, NKJV; also Luke 4:12).

In all three temptations, Jesus responds with the words “It is written.” That is, Jesus goes right to the Word of God and nothing else to deal with the attacks and deceptions of Satan. This should be a powerful lesson to all of us: the Bible, and the Bible alone, is the ultimate standard and foundation of our belief.

Yes, the Bible and the Bible alone was Jesus’ method of defense against the attacks of the adversary. Jesus is God, but in His defense against Satan He submits Himself solely to the Word of God. It is not opinion; it is not an elaborate, convoluted argument; it is not with words of personal animosity; it is instead by the simple yet profound words of Scripture. For Christ, Scripture has the greatest authority and the greatest power. In this way, His ministry begins with a certain foundation and continues to build upon the trustworthiness of the Bible.

`How can we learn to be just as reliant on the Word of God, and as submissive to it?`
