Read This Week’s Passage: Hebrews 11:23–29

**Where Was God?**

He was slated to be the first man to break the four-minute mile at the Olympics. When he was twenty-six years old, however, Louis Zamperini boarded the Green Hornet, a wobbly B-24 bomber, in late May 1943, during World War II. The plane went down over the Pacific, forcing him and his pilot to travel 2,000 miles on a tenuous raft with no water or food.

What followed is a series of events that went from bad to worse. This great Olympic athlete spent nearly fifty days at sea, battling starvation, dehydration, and battles with sharks and enemy planes. After surviving the most trying of circumstances, he became a prisoner of war and endured torture beyond human imagination, disease, and psychological trauma. Although he survived the war, he did so with a difficult re-entry that included hatred, nightmares, flashbacks, and alcoholism.

When evil is unleashed and has its own way with people full of so much promise—when morality is overcome by evil—how is it possible for an all-loving God to exist at the same time, in the same place? To answer these questions, God points to sacred history, where the lives of great men and women who learned the value of true education changed the world.
