Read This Week’s Passage: Proverbs 4:5–15

Wisdom and Character

Although the Bible speaks of God’s wisdom as a hidden treasure above the highest heavens (Job 28:21), it also commands us to get it at all cost. There is a healthy tension between the unreachability and the mandate to acquire wisdom. In fact, throughout Scripture we find many promises regarding this great virtue. Perhaps one of the greatest revelations about wisdom is that the God of wisdom is so willing to give it: “If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him” (James 1:5).

But what is wisdom and how does it differ from knowledge? How does it intersect with character? Why is it important in the work of education? In this week’s study, we will seek to answer these questions and provide clarity between these often seemingly abstract notions.
