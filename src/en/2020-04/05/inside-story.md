#### Finding Freedom in Rwanda

_By Lucette N’Diay Mitrac_

I don’t know why I volunteered to preach at Total Member Involvement evangelistic meetings in Rwanda in May 2016. Other than me, only young people volunteered to preach when coordinator Duane McKey invited our Seventh-day Adventist church in Paris to participate. I was weak after a long illness, and my 23-year-old son recently had committed suicide. But I signed up and quickly was asked to supervise the young people, not to preach. 

Things changed after our arrival in Nyanza, Rwanda. We met with the local pastors, and I was asked to preach. I fled to my hotel room and fell on my knees. “Lord, I have never preached,” I prayed. “But since You said it is not by might nor by power, but by Your Spirit, please speak instead of me.”

Starting with the first evening meeting, childhood memories flooded my mind as I spoke about the transforming power of the gospel. Rwandans had suffered horrific rape and violence during 1990s genocide. I had gone through similar trials and spoke from my heart. Every time I made an altar call, people were moved, especially women who had been raped. Many came to the front.

The more I spoke, the more I was healed. Although I had given my heart to Jesus many years earlier, I realized that I still held a grudge. I knew that God had not deprived me of my childhood and my mother, but I still blamed Him.

My stepfather used to rape me. I only told my mother when I was 13. She took me to a gynecologist and sent me to live with a cousin. Shortly afterward, she visited me on a Friday. I never saw her again. My stepfather killed her.

My stepfather spent only two years in prison because he was a high-ranking military officer. I lived in an orphanage from the age of 13 to 19. My biological father was alive, but he didn’t want anything to do with me. I felt so lonely. 

I found healing in the Bible. I read, “The Mighty One, will save; He will rejoice over you with gladness. . . . He who touches you touches the apple of His eye. . . . The Lord has appeared of old to me, saying: ‘Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love’ ” (Zeph. 3:17; Zech. 2:8; Jer. 31:3, NKJV). But I didn’t love myself. Even if people told me that I was pretty, I didn’t feel pretty inside.

In Rwanda, the dark negativity faded as I spoke. I knew it wasn’t me preaching. I found freedom and accepted Christ’s loving declaration that I am a wonderful creature. A total of 390 people were baptized at Cyegera Seventh-day Adventist Church. 

Today I am 66, and I have returned to Rwanda many times. My Rwandan friends are my family, and they call me “Mama.” I am working now so many people will become new creatures in Christ.

Thank you for your Sabbath School mission offerings that help spread the gospel around the world.
