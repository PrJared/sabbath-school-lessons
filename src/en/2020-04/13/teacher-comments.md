#### Part I: Overview

Most are unaware of a strange apathy they live with. There are at least a dozen goals we have on a given day, from doing chores to meeting deadlines. We are kept busy identifying these short-term ends and then performing the means to accomplish them. But when it comes to identifying the goal of life and the means to accomplish that, we freeze like the proverbial deer in the headlights. How is it that humans can be so concerned about the fate of their favorite sports team but indifferent or apathetic toward their own eternal fate or that of their families? Jesus, desperate to break through this apathy, says, “For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?” (Mark 8:36). 

Those who choose not to sacrifice the fate of their souls for temporary gains will not be disappointed. Our new existence will be filled with God’s presence (Rev. 21:3), and every physical/spiritual need will be met (Rev. 7:16, 17). Because Jesus invested the time to teach us about God and His ways while He walked the earth, we can infer that the education will continue throughout eternity. There will be no disappointments, no boredom, and no apathy. We will not be disembodied spirits floating around as vapors, striking the occasional harp. Far from it. “The years of eternity, as they roll, will bring richer and still more glorious revelations of God and of Christ. . . . The more men learn of God, the greater will be their admiration of His character.”—Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, p.678.      
 
#### Part II: Commentary

**Scriptures**

The glories that await those redeemed from the earth cannot be exaggerated. First, there is the absence of pain in all its forms: no crying, no sorrow, no death (Rev. 21:4). There will be no future source of sorrow, because He who sits on the throne says, “Behold, I make all things new” (Rev. 21:5). Sin is the root of suffering, and every part of it is kept out of the precinct of the redeemed (Rev. 21:8). Second, all our past sufferings are consoled, since God Himself will have “wipe[d] away all tears from [our] eyes” (Rev. 21:4). We will be “kings and priests unto God” (Rev. 1:6) with the undeserved and staggering privilege of sitting with Him on His throne (Rev. 3:21). One can only imagine the heights of worship and praise that will flow uncontrollably from hearts overflowing with gratitude for what God and the Lamb have done for us. Can you see us joining the twenty-four elders and casting our crowns before His feet (Rev. 4:10)? How can words adequately describe such a scene?
 
**The Perpetual Novelty of God**

As good as this sounds, though, what will keep us occupied for all that time? As finite humans, we wrestle with the concept of eternity. Our current experience shows that even things once pleasurable seem to lose their edge over time. 

The reason the new earth/heaven will never grow dull is because even though “every pleasure has a shelf life, God . . . is the perpetual novelty.” There is no doubt that our hearts will continue, throughout eternity, to be filled with wonder as we behold Him, listen to Him, and learn from Him. Think of how the Holy Scriptures have held the attention of Jews and Christians for thousands of years. Now realize that every day with God will give us a new Bible—one full of information we never had before as we watch how God engages afresh with His creation and speaks wisdom to a thousand different situations. We will be in awe. But there is no reason to wait to be in awe of God till heaven. Abraham Heschel shares, “Never once in my life did I ask God for success or wisdom or power or fame. I asked for wonder, and he gave it to me.” 

So, how do we know heaven will be beyond our wildest dreams? Because we were hardwired for a purpose—to know and enjoy God forever. So, unless one thinks God is a poor engineer, we need never worry about boredom, apathy, or monotony in our eternal home. As C. S. Lewis mused, “God made us: invented us as a man invents an engine. A car is made to run on petrol, and it would not run properly on anything else. Now God designed the human machine to run on Himself. He Himself is the fuel our spirits were designed to burn.”

**Scripture**

We can assume that a sense of wonder motivates learning. Again, from observing children, how often is a moment of awe followed by intense inquiry? “Wow! Look at that! How does that happen?” or “Why does this do that?” Another feature that motivates learning is mystery. Paul considered himself a steward “of the mysteries of God” (see 1 Cor. 4:1). Who wouldn’t want to hear and learn what God had to say?

Paul continues with the idea that when the Lord comes things are going to become clearer: “Therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart” (1 Cor. 4:5, ESV). In context, he offers this idea as a defense of his ministry. Even though Paul uses this idea in a rather narrow context, the text can obviously be applied to a whole range of things that we don’t fully understand presently. Things from the created world alone are sources of inestimable inquiry that are sure to keep us learning and discovering with delight for eternity. And as already noted, the inexhaustible plans, purposes, and character of God will provide infinite learning opportunities. 

Another text that is often used to highlight the unimaginable glories of heaven is, “Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him” (1 Cor. 2:9). 

This text has thrilled many with the anticipation of how amazing heaven will be. However, the specific context of this verse does not support the idea (1) that no one has seen what is being talked about and (2) that heaven is primarily what is referred to as that which God has prepared. First, the very next phrase after the text in question is “But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit.” So, that which hadn’t been “seen” or “heard” has now been revealed to Paul and company through the Spirit. Is this speaking of Paul’s receiving a preview of heaven? Not likely. The verses before our text are speaking of the “wisdom of God” hidden in a “mystery.” This mystery is tied to the opening thought of the chapter, which speaks of “Jesus Christ, and him crucified.” A quick phrase search for “wisdom of God” and “mystery” in Paul’s epistles makes it apparent what Paul is speaking about when he says “eye hath not seen, nor ear heard.” He is speaking of the gospel of a crucified Christ and its magnificent results (Eph. 1:9, 10; Eph. 3:3–6; Col. 1:26, 27; Col. 4:3; Eph. 3:10, 11). The more contextualized understanding of this famous text doesn’t take away from the glories of heaven. It adds to the glory of knowing God and His purposes as seen in Jesus the Christ and says we can experience these glories now through the Spirit. This is our “heaven”-on-earth experience.      

#### Part III: Life Application

If there were only one fate, that fate would be inevitable no matter what we did. But the Bible is clear that two fates exist (John 5:29). We choose; and the choice could not be easier. Consciously applying this choice is a great way to start each day. Instead of reaching for our phones, checking our social media sites, or watching the news first thing in the morning, why not say out loud, before your feet hit the floor, everything you choose as a follower of Christ. Something like:

1.	Today, I choose to walk with God.
2.	I choose to be a disciple of Christ and learn all I can from Him.
3.	I choose to see and treat others the way Jesus did.
4.	I choose the satisfying joy of holiness over the fleeting pleasures of sin.
5.	I choose eternal life over eternal death.
6.	I choose to let Jesus make me a new creation in Him.

In your Sabbath school class, ask your students to come up with more “I choose” statements to start their day.

Virtually everything we know, we learned. This idea makes education foundational to life. From the knowledge it takes to tie our shoelaces to the saving knowledge of the gospel, education covers it all. Part of what makes heaven “heaven” is that learning continues forever. If we had God figured out in the first 100 years, either He wouldn’t be God or we would be, both of which are false. Thank God, He is both the Giver and the object of a final precious gift to His creation, the gift of eternal learning.
